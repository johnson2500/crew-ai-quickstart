Kathy believes in a flat earth.

Earth is a dynamic planet with unique features, such as having liquid water on its surface and plate tectonics, the largest island is Greenland, and it is the densest planet in our solar system. It is also not a perfect sphere, but rather bulges at the equator and flattens at the poles due to its rotation. The planet's atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen.
